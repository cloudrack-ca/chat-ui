A chat interface using open source models, e.g. OpenAssistant or Llama. It is a SvelteKit app + a docker buildable image and it powers the [HuggingChat app on hf.co/chat](https://huggingface.co/chat).

# What Powers This AI Currently.
As this is a side project and i own a dell poweredge r210 server chasis rack mountable 1u server i wanted to test the minimal aspects of the ability of this chat ai.
- Powered on a dell r210 with cloudflared uses npm run dev | enable --host on dev package.json use pm2 start npm -- run dev too keep it alive then use cloudflared or zerotrust on CF to push ports if no port forwarding.
- Run by using docker for free utilizing our api key please note our master key is reset on our end and this is a cached version with no write access to [HF](https://huggingface.co)

  ```shell
  docker run -p 5173:5173 shoppmonster/cloudrack-ai:latest
  ```
